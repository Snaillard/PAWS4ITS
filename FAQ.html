                        <h3>ADOPTION & REHOMING</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How can I adopt from PAWS?</li>
							</br>
							<p>Applicants go through a screening process to ensure that our rescued animals go to loving homes. The process includes an online interview via Zoom and at least two (2) separate shelter visits to meet and get to know your chosen pet </p>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can you adopt my pet?</li>
							<p> PAWS does NOT adopt owned pets. We already have 300+ shelter animals rescued from cruelty and neglect that are waiting to be adopted. If you need to give up your pet for some reason, please consider other options or apply for rehoming assistance. </p>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Why is there an adoption fee?</li>
							<p> The adoption fee is a token of your commitment and and a demonstration of your financial capacity to care for a pet. P500 for cats / P1000 for dogs is a small price which already covers your pet’s spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations and tick+flea treatment. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> I live in the province/abroad. Can I still adopt?</li>
							<p> Yes, but special arrangements need to be made for the meet-and-greet, depending on your location. Please contact us to discuss your options. You may also opt to adopt from your local pound instead</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I return my adopted pet if I change my mind?</li>
							<p>Yes. Some reasons for denied applications include: Not being able to keep their pet indoors, incompatibility with the household, plus other circumstances that may be damaging to the health, safety, and happiness of our shelter animals. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Do you have purebred cats or dogs?</li>
							<p> A pet is a lifetime commitment. However, if you truly can’t keep your adopted pet, please don’t abandon them on the streets or with strangers. Please return them to us so we can find another home for them. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Do you have puppies or kittens for adoption?</li>
							<p>It is very rare that purebred cats or dogs are admitted to the shelter. Sadly, they are valued more than aspins and puspins who are equally deserving of a home. Please consider adopting a local breed instead. </p>
							</br>

                        <hr>
                        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;">
                            </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Animal Control vs. Animal Welfare - what's the difference?</li>
							<p> Animal control deals with the stray animal population, complaints regarding pet waste and sanitation, and animals becoming a nuisance to the community or posing a risk to public health. Animal welfare refers to the well-being of animals. It aims to promote responsible pet ownership and put an end to animal cruelty</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What is the city pound?</li>
							<p> The City Pound operates under the LGU. It is their responsibility to keep the stray dog population under control in accordance with the Anti-Rabies Act. Dogs caught by the city pound are kept for a number of days in case they have owners who wish to claim them. If they are not claimed within the holding period, they are euthanized or put to death </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Do you pick up stray animals?</li>
							<p> It’s impossible to rescue all stray animals, so we give priority to victims of cruelty and neglect or those whose life is in imminent danger. For concerns related to animal control, please contact your LGU or city pound. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Is it legal to trap and move stray animals to a different location?</li>
							<p>Only the LGU or the City Veterinarian is authorized to trap or catch stray animals when they receive reports of such animals becoming a nuisance to the community or posing a risk to public health. Captured animals must be brought to the pound. Dumping them elsewhere (“niligaw”) is illegal. </p>
							</br>
							
                        </ul>

                            </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How do I report animal cruelty?</li>
							<p>Animal cruelty MUST be reported to your barangay officials and/or police hotline 911 IMMEDIATELY. You may also seek free legal assistance from PAWS. As the witness and reporting citizen, you will need to execute an affidavit so that PAWS can file the case and appear in court.</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> My neighbor is neglecting their pet. Can you help?</li>
							<p>Please talk to your neighbor first and attempt to educate them in a friendly manner. PAWS cannot intervene or confiscate an owned pet without legal grounds. If you wish to file a case, please follow due process so that PAWS can assist. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Is dog "katay" legal?</li>
							<p> NO. If you see dog slaughter in progress, you must stop it IMMEDIATELY and report it to the barangay. In many cases, it is enough to save the animal’s life.  </p>
							</br>
							
                        </ul>

							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What should I do if I see an injured stray animal?</li>
							<p> YOU are their best chance of survival. Calling PAWS does not guarantee that the animal will be rescued due to limited space at the shelter and not enough volunteers. However, our vet can assist in emergency cases if you are willing to transport and foster the animal </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can you treat a homeless victim of hit-and-run?</li>
							<p>Calling PAWS does not guarantee that the animal will be rescued due to limited space at the shelter and not enough volunteers. Hit-and-run victims need immediate care, and waiting for someone else to respond may cost the animal’s life. Our vet can assist if you are willing to transport and foster the animal </p>

                           </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How do I donate to PAWS?</li>
							<p> We accept cash donations via bank transfer, Gcash and Paypal. Donations in kind are also accepted and can be delivered to the shelter or ordered from our partner shops</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I donate my pet to you?</li>
							<p>Pets are not donations. A donation is meant to help a charity organization and leaving your pet with us is the opposite of helping. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What is a "Supporting Member"?</li>
							<p>A Supporting Member regularly donates a minimum of P300/month. Supporting Members are also considered active PAWS Volunteers and can participate in events such as fundraisers and other shelter activities. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Do you issue donation certificates?</li>
							<p>In addition to a receipt, we can issue a PAWS donation certificate upon request as long as we are given a few days’ notice </p>

                        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;">
                           </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I take my sick pet to your clinic?</li>
							<p> The PAWS clinic is open to spay/neuter clients only. Please take your pet to other vet clinics that are better equipped to treat your pet.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Where can I get free or low-cost vet care?</li>
							<p>Please contact your local city vet </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> I can't afford my vet bills. Can you help?</li>
							<p>Unfortunately, PAWS cannot help with vet bills of other veterinary clinics. As a charity organization, we can only raise funds for the rescued animals directly under our care.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How do I care for nursing kittens/puppies?</li>
							<p> The first thing to do is to take the kitten or puppy to the vet in case first aid treatment is required. Nursing kittens and puppies need round-the-clock monitoring for at least 2 weeks. They cannot be left at the shelter where they are prone to infections, cold temperatures, and no one to look after them. They will surely die</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can a shelter animal be a blood donor for my pet?</li>
							<p> Our shelter residents cannot be used as blood donors. They are all rescued from cruelty or neglect and are not in the best condition to be blood donors. Their stay at the shelter only has one goal: their own rehabilitation.</p>
							</br>
                        </ul>

							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Does the barangay/HOA have the authority to take my pets?</li>
							<p>If your pet is kept within your property, nobody can force you to relinquish your pet. If there are sanitation or noise complaints, there is due process with written notices and hearings where you can defend your case. Do not voluntarily surrender your pet without following due process. To avoid this issue, always keep your pet indoors and practice proper animal waste disposal.</p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Our condominium admin is imposing unreasonable pet policies. What can we do?</li>
							<p> Lobby for changes with your fellow pet owners by writing to the admin. Send them a written proposal indicating your willingness as a group to keep the premises clean, pick up after your pet, and keep your pet on a leash in common areas. Specify sanctions for erring unit owners to demonstrate your willingness to govern oneself as a group. Doing this can make the condo admin more accommodating to pets. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What can I do if a breeder/pet shop sold me a sick pet?</li>
							<p>This is not an animal welfare concern but an issue covered by consumer law. Please consult a private lawyer for advice.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> My pet got run over ("nasagasaan"). What can I do?</li>
							<p>These cases are handled by the barangay or police. You may press charges, but also remember that allowing your pet to roam freely outside your home (even in the presence of the owner) is a violation of RA9482 or The Anti Rabies Act. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can you help me convince my landlord to allow pets in the property?</li>
							<p>PAWS cannot influence your landlord’s pet-keeping policies. However, we can help you ask permission to foster or temporarily keep an animal in case of an emergency rescue. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> My ex gave me a pet and now he wants it back. Can I refuse?</li>
							<p>This is not an animal welfare concern but a property dispute. Please consult a private lawyer for advice.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What can I do about vet malpractice?</li>
							<p>A comprehensive investigation, including a necropsy if your pet has died, will determine whether malpractice occurred in the treatment of your pet. Please bring your pet to a clinic that offers this service. You will also need to consult a private lawyer if you wish to press charges. </p>

							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> I found a missing pet. Can I take it to PAWS?</li>

                        <hr>
						
                        <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4" style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify;">
                            </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How much do you charge for "kapon"?</li>
							<p>Our basic fees are as follows: </p>
							<p>Female cat – Php 1,000  </p>
							<p>Female dog – Php 1,500 </p>
							<p>Male dog – Php 1,000 </p>
							<p>Additional fees will be charged depending on the animal’s breed, health condition and weight. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Why should I spay/neuter my pet?</li>
							<p>In addition to avoiding unwanted litters, they will also avoid a number of illnesses and infections if they are neutered, therefore helping them live longer and happier lives </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can my pet die from the surgery?</li>
							<p>Spay and neuter surgeries are safe procedures. The risks are not related to the surgery itself, but to pre-existing conditions that your pet may have. This is why we require a blood test to ensure that your pet is healthy before the surgery. Complications may arise during the procedure, but that is also the case with any other type of surgery, and it is relatively rare.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Will my pet gain weight after being spayed/neutered?</li>
							<p>Physiological and hormonal changes may affect your pet’s metabolism and appetite, making them prone to weight gain. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Do you offer free spay/neuter surgery?</li>
							<p>We offer free kapon at the shelter every February. Please follow our Facebook or Instagram for updates on when the next one is scheduled and how to register. You may also coordinate with your LGU and request to organize a kapon outreach in your area.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can you spay/neuter the stray cats in our neighborhood?</li>
							<p>Yes, but it has to be under an organized TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) program with your community. Proper TNR is the ONLY sustainable solution to our stray population problems. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can spaying/neutering fix my pet’s behavioral problems?</li>
							<p>It can only reduce undesirable behavior that is caused by the heat cycle, such as aggressiveness, marking or spraying, or the tendency to run away to search for a mate. Proper training is still the best way to have a well-mannered pet.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Is it true that I should wait until they have their first litter before spaying/neutering?</li>
							<p>There is no scientific basis for this. In fact, science tells us that it’s better to spay /neuter your pet before their first heat. Waiting for a first litter is completely unnecessary — even risky, since complications may arise while giving birth and it could be fatal.  </p>

                            </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Should I feed the stray animals in my area?</li>
							<p>It may seem like the kind thing to do, but feeding stray animals will increase the stray population within the community and they may eventually be viewed as pests. We strongly encourage you to organize a TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) program instead and learn about responsible feeding. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What can I do about stray cats in my neighborhood?</li>
							<p>Proper TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) is the ONLY sustainable solution. DO NOT remove or exterminate them. It is cruel and will only attract new cats. </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> A stray animal got run over ("nasagasaan"). What can I do?</li>
							<p>Find help on-site by calling the barangay or traffic enforcers. The injured animal must be taken to the vet by whatever means necessary. </p>

							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can we interview a PAWS officer for a school project/research assignment?</li>

							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can we conduct a study or experiment on the shelter animals?</li>
							<p>We will not allow our shelter animals to become subjects for tests or experiments. They are all going through physical and behavioral rehabilitation and must not be subjected to further stress.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I apply as a student intern?</li>

                            </br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> How can I volunteer for PAWS?</li>
							<p>Volunteer applicants must first attend the volunteer orientation to see what assignments suit them. Please follow our Facebook or Instagram for updates on when the next volunteer orientation is scheduled </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I volunteer without attending the orientation?</li>
							<p>Yes, you can do this by participating in our Shelter Feeding, Shelter Cleaning or Project Calm programs. These are volunteer activities that you can organize with your workmates, classmates, family or friends.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I submit my application form on the day of the orientation?</li>
							<p>No. All applications must be submitted within the designated period so that we have time to screen and confirm all attendees before the scheduled orientation date.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Is there an age requirement for volunteers?</li>
							<p>No. However, minors are required to attend the orientation with a parent or guardian. When volunteering, children below 13 must also be supervised by their parent or guardian </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Is there a time quota for volunteer work?</li>
							<p>No. Some people volunteer only once a week, once a month, or whenever their schedule allows it. Shelter volunteer work must be within operating hours. (Monday-Saturday except Wednesdays and holidays, between 8am to 5pm) </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> Can I get a volunteer certificate if I volunteer?</li>
							<p>As a charity organization, we do not give volunteer certificates to students for academic compliance. Volunteering is generally considered an altruistic activity where one dedicates their time and resources for no financial or social gain.  </p>
							</br>
							
							</br>
							<li><i class='bx bxs-check-circle'></i> What is an "active volunteer"?</li>
							<p>They are volunteers who render at least eight (8) hours a month doing shelter or out-of-shelter work. Active volunteers get included in special activities, events, and workshops. Volunteers who foster shelter animals are automatically awarded their 8-hours for each month that they foster. </p>
